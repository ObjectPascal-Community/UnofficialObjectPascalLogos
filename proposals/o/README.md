Designer note:
The aim was to create the logo with an abstract design, ensuring it stands on its own without resembling any specific object or concept. The reasoning behind this decision is that language is a tool we use for thinking, communicating, and conveying meanings. Moreover, a shape resembling other objects requires an initial explanation. Given that language precedes everything else, we need an independent visual form that doesn't necessitate translation.

Considerations for the logo center on conveying advanced, light, and free values. Regal blue was chosen to instill trust and evoke a sense of consistency. The selected typeface is based on Helvetica (celebrated as one of the most widely used and flawless typefaces, originating from Switzerlandâ€”the same birthplace as Pascal), with some minor refinements to enhance optical adjustments and geometrical characters.
